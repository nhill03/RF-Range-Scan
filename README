This is the github repository to be used by Noah Hill and Jay Zebryk, to
develop a program which automates acquisition and logging of RF Range Scan
data. The program will be written in Python and deployed on a Raspberry Pi.
Data will be logged to a CSV file within the Raspberry Pi, and measurements
will be taken with the ADS1115 16-bit ADC.

The first iteration of this program explores simple connection to the ADS1115
using I2C protocol, reading values from all four channels, and printing data to
a CSV file. This python script is named helloworld.py. The
Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15 folder contains examples and documentation provided by
Adafruit.
